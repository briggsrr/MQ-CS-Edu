### Background 
In this module, we will dive into an often overlooked, yet extremely crucial
  aspect of software design: version controls systems. Why do VCSs matter? In a collaborative setting, 
  it is extemely important to know the whos, whens and whys of a project for effiency and debugging purposes. 
  By allowing teams to look at snapshots of old projects, log changes, and even revert to old verions of code, 
  VCSs have become a necessity in all modern software settings. 

  Some common VCSs include `Mercurial`, `Apache Subversion `, and `Beanstock`, but the reigning champion of version control and focus of this module is `Git`. Although Git is underlying beatifully and simple, its interface a leaky abstraction: its tidiness and simplicity doesn't hide the details it is meant to hide, often leading to confusion and misunderstandings amongst users. Hopefully this module will clear the air with VCSs and Git, enabling you fully understand what is happening the next time you push code.
