My name is `Bobby Briggs` and my pronouns are `he/him/his`. I am very interested in tutoring for `CS16`, `CS24` for the upcoming winter quarter and `CS156` in the spring. 

As a ULA, it would be an exciting learning experience to be exposed to unique problems other students are experiencing and collaboratively working toward a solution.
