## 1. Background  
In this module, we will dive into the world of shell, exposing the many underutilized tools available allowing you to utilize your computer to it's maximum potential. "Computers these days have a variety of interfaces for giving them commands; fanciful graphical user interfaces, voice interfaces, and even AR/VR are everywhere. These are great for 80% of use-cases, but they are often fundamentally restricted in what they allow you to do — you cannot press a button that isn’t there or give a voice command that hasn’t been programmed. To take full advantage of the tools your computer provides, we have to go old-school and drop down to a textual interface: The Shell. Nearly all platforms you can get your hand on has a shell in one form or another, and many of them have several shells for you to choose from. While they may vary in the details, at their core they are all roughly the same: they allow you to run programs, give them input, and inspect their output in a semi-structured way. (1)"

## 2. Shell Setup and Configuration
A `shell program` is (typically) an executable binary whose commands are turned into system calls to the operating system application programming interface, or `OS API` for short. In this module, we will use the `zsh` which is built on `bash`. Feel free to use either: note that `zsh` is more interactive and customizable than `bash`. Learn more about setting up `zsh` [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).
